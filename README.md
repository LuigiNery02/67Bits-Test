This project was created as part of a game art implementation test for a game company. I was responsible for designing all the game's art and integrating it into the Unity project provided by the company.

The test involved adapting the visual style to match the project's needs while ensuring smooth implementation within Unity. It required skills in 2D/3D asset creation, optimization for real-time rendering, and proper scene assembly.

In addition to the art, I also created and implemented animations, background music, sound effects (SFX), and visual effects (VFX). I worked on custom shaders to enhance the visuals and improve the overall player experience.

This project demonstrates my ability to work within an existing development framework, implement high-quality game art, and optimize assets for a seamless gameplay experience. It also highlights my skills in animation, music composition, sound design, and integrating VFX and shaders into the game.
